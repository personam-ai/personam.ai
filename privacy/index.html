Renewal of Subscription Terms. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless otherwise</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">provided in an applicable Order Form, the term of each subscription shall (a) be for one year (the “Subscription Term”) and (b) automatically renew for additional periods equal to the expiring Subscription Term, unless either party gives the other notice (email is acceptable) of non-renewal at least 30 days before the end of the expiring Subscription Term. The pricing during any renewal term may increase, provided that Personam.ai provides Subscriber notice of different pricing at least 45 days prior to the effective date of such fee increase.</span></p>
<p><b>7.3. Termination. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either party may terminate these Terms, including all applicable Order Forms, immediately and without further notice upon (a) a material breach by the other party of a material term or condition of these Terms, if such breach remains uncured within 30 days after the non-breaching party gives written notice of breach to the breaching party, (b) the institution by or against the other party of insolvency, receivership, or bankruptcy proceedings or any other proceedings for the settlement of the other party’s debts, (c) the other party making an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (d) the other party’s dissolution or ceasing to do business.

Termination or expiration of these Terms or an applicable Order Form shall not extinguish any of Subscriber’s or Personam.ai’s obligations under these Terms or the applicable Order Form that, by their nature, continue after the date of termination or expiration, including the obligation to pay any unpaid but due Fees and the confidentiality obligations of each party hereunder.</span></p>
<ol start="8">
<li><b> Fees and Payment .</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>8.1. Fees. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subscriber will pay all fees applicable to Subscriber’s selected Subscription Level (“Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in an applicable Order Form: (a) Fees are based on subscriptions to the Personam.ai Platform and Personam.ai Services, not actual usage; and (b) payment obligations are non-cancelable and Fees paid are non-refundable. Fees are fixed for one calendar year from the initial effective date of the first Subscription Term, but may be modified thereafter as set forth in Section 7.2.</span></p>
<p><b>8.2. Invoicing and Payment. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subscriber will provide Personam.ai with valid and updated credit card information, or with a valid purchase order or alternative payment method acceptable to Personam.ai. If Subscriber provides credit card information to Personam.ai, Subscriber authorizes Personam.ai to charge such credit card for all Fees due hereunder. Except as otherwise set forth in an applicable Order Form, payment of Fees shall be made in advance, monthly or annually or in accordance with any different billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form. Unless otherwise stated in an applicable Order Form, invoiced Fees are due upon execution of the order. Subscriber is responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Personam.ai and notifying Personam.ai of any changes to such information, as well as for payment of any fees or charges associated with Subscriber payment other than those charged by Personam.ai’s or its Affiliate’s bank.</span></p>
<p><b>8.3. Overdue Charges. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If payment of any Fees is not received by Personam.ai by the due date, without limiting Personam.ai’s other rights or remedies: (a) unpaid Fees may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, and/or (b) Personam.ai may condition future subscription renewals and Order Forms on payment terms shorter than those specified in the “Invoicing and Payment” section above.</span></p>
<p><b>8.4. Suspension and Acceleration. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any Fees are 30 days or more overdue, (or ten or more days overdue in the case of amounts Subscriber has authorized Personam.ai to charge to Subscriber’s credit card), Personam.ai may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, accelerate any unpaid Fees obligations so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and/or suspend Subscriber’s access to the Personam.ai Platform and Personam.ai Services until such amounts are paid in full; provided that if Subscriber is paying by credit card or direct debit and payment has been declined by the applicable financial institution, Personam.ai will give Subscriber at least ten days’ prior notice that such payment is overdue before suspending Subscriber’s access to the Personam.ai Platform and Personam.ai Services.</span></p>
<p><b>8.5. Payment Disputes. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personam.ai will not exercise its rights under the “Overdue Charges” or “Suspension and Acceleration” sections above for 60 days if Subscriber is disputing the applicable Fees reasonably and in good faith and are cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute.</span></p>
<p><b>8.6. Taxes. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including value-added, sales, use, or withholding taxes, assessable by any local, state, provincial, federal or foreign jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). Subscriber is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with purchases hereunder. If Personam.ai has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Subscriber is responsible under this Section, Personam.ai will invoice Subscriber and Subscriber will pay that amount unless Subscriber provides Personam.ai with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, Personam.ai is solely responsible for taxes assessable against it based on its income, property, and employees.</span></p>

<li><b> Confidentiality .</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>9.1. Definition of Confidential Information. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Confidential Information” means all non-public information disclosed by a party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”), whether electronically, orally, or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and/or the circumstances of disclosure. Personam.ai’s Confidential Information includes the Personam.ai Platform, Personam.ai Services, Aggregate Data, contact and identity information of Subscribers and visitors to any Personam.ai website, and the terms and conditions of these Terms (including all Order Forms and pricing). Confidential Information of each party includes business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business processes disclosed by such party. However, Confidential Information does not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (c) is received from a third party without breach of any contractual, legal, or fiduciary obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to, or reliance upon, the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. Each party retains all ownership, right, and title in and to its Confidential Information.</span></p>
<p><b>9.2. Protection of Confidential Information. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except as otherwise permitted in writing by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will (a) use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information (but in no event less than reasonable care) to protect the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; (b) not use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose not authorized by these Terms; and (c) except as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to, and disclosure of, the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its and its Affiliates’ employees and contractors who need that access for purposes consistent with these Terms and who have signed confidentiality agreements with the Receiving Party containing protections not materially less protective of the Confidential Information than those herein. Neither party will disclose the terms of these Terms or any Order Form to any third party other than its Affiliates, legal counsel, and accountants without the other party’s prior written consent; provided that a party that makes any such disclosure to its Affiliate, legal counsel, or accountants will remain responsible for such Affiliate’s, legal counsel’s, or accountant’s compliance with this “Confidentiality” section. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) Personam.ai may disclose the terms of these Terms and any applicable Order Form to a subcontractor to the extent necessary to perform Personam.ai’s obligations related to these Terms, under terms of confidentiality materially as protective as those set forth herein and (ii) Personam.ai may provide access to Subscriber Confidential Information to those Users, employees, contractors, and agents whom Subscriber permits to use and manage Subscriber access and use of the Personam.ai Platform and Personam.ai Services.</span></p>
<p><b>9.3. Compelled Disclosure. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party&#8217;s cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information.</span></p>

<p><b>Data Protection Addendum</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Data Protection Addendum (“DPA”) is made a part of your Subscriber Terms of Use (“Terms”), and governs solely to the extent that: (a) you, or any person (“Person”) from whom Personam.ai collects Personal Data (defined below), is located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;), Canada, or Australia; (b) you and/or such Person is subject to Data Protection Laws (defined below); and (c) your access and use of the Personam.ai Platform involve the collection or processing of the Personal Data of an individual located in the EEA, the UK, Canada, or Australia. To the extent this DPA applies, and in consideration of the mutual obligations set out in this DPA, you and Personam.ai agree that this DPA is a binding part of the Terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except as modified in this DPA, the terms and conditions of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect. If there is any conflict between this DPA and the Terms regarding Personam.ai’s privacy or security obligations, the provisions of this DPA shall control. Unless expressly defined in the DPA, all capitalized terms used herein will have the meaning assigned to them in the Terms.</span></p>
<p><b>Purpose: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of compliance with Data Protection Laws concerning the processing of Personal Data on behalf of Personam.ai Platform users located in European Union (“EU”) Member States or members of the European Economic Area, the UK, Canada, and Australia, and incorporates (to the extent applicable) the terms of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”). “Data Protection Law” means, as applicable, the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) (“GDPR”), including applicable laws implementing or supplementing the GDPR and as transposed into domestic legislation of Member States, as amended, replaced or superseded from time to time); the UK Data Protection Act of 2018, the Australian Privacy Principles and the Australian Privacy Act (1988); or the Canadian Federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.

The term “ Personal Data” includes: first and last name, email address, telephone number, mailing address, and other information necessary to identify an individual for purposes of assisting Personam.ai with providing use of the Personam.ai Platform.</span></p>
<p><b>Context and Scope of Personal Data Processing: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to provide the Subscribers with access and use of the Personam.ai Platform, it may be necessary for Personam.ai to collect Personal Data of such an individual or an employee or other representative or user of the Subscriber (each, a “Customer Representative”). Such data is collected when Customer Representatives provide their Personal Data directly to Personam.ai as an account holder, a designated point of contact between Subscriber and Personam.ai, or a user under the Subscriber account . That data is subsequently used by Personam.ai solely to provide access to the Personam.ai Platform and the Personam.ai Services under the Terms, or as may be necessary to assist with any requests regarding use and proper operation of the Personam.ai Platform.</span></p>
<p><b>Obligations under Data Protection Laws:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Processing as a Controller. Generally, Personam.ai shall act as the Controller of the Personal Data of each Customer Representative. As a Controller, Personam.ai will comply with all data protection requirements under the Data Protection Laws applicable to the Personal Data. Without limiting the foregoing, as a controller of the Personal Data, Personam.ai shall be responsible for providing notifications to, and respond to inquiries and requests from, the Customer Representatives; provided, however, that to the extent necessary, the Subscriber shall reasonably cooperate with Personam.ai for the purpose of responding to requests by Customer Representatives or any government authorities and of generally complying with Personam.ai &#8216;s obligations under the Data Protection Laws. To the extent applicable, nothing herein relieves the Subscriber of their own obligations under the applicable Data Protection Laws. The parties are not entering a relationship of joint controllership.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Processing as a Processor. In the event any personal data is processed by Personam.ai as a Processor, the parties shall specifically identify such personal data and the purposes of processing, as well as the measures undertaken to protect such data, by completing Appendix B (Controller-to-Processor). As a Processor, Personam.ai shall only process Personal Data in accordance with the Customer Representative’s documented instructions. As required under Data Protection Laws, Personam.ai shall assist the Customer Representative, where appropriate, in ensuring compliance with the Customer Representative’s obligations pursuant to Data Protection Laws, taking into account the nature and scope of Personam.ai’s Personal Data processing, which may include providing commercially reasonable cooperation and assistance with: (a) data subject requests (see below); (b) notifications or communications regarding personal data breaches; (c) data protection impact assessments; and (d) prior consultations with supervisory authorities.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With respect to any Personal Data processed by Personam.ai as a Processor pursuant to this DPA, Personam.ai shall: (a) in the event Personam.ai engages trusted third parties to process Personal Data (“Trusted Parties”), seek the prior specific or general written authorization of the Controller, which is hereby given in respect of any Trusted Parties expressly listed below (and in the case of general written authorization, the Processor shall inform the Controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of Trusted Parties, thereby giving the Controller the opportunity to object to such changes); (b) unless prohibited under applicable law, upon termination of the Services, at its option, either return or destroy the Personal Data (including all copies of it); (c) ensure that all persons authorized by Personam.ai to access the Personal Data on Personam.ai ’s behalf, are subject to obligations of confidentiality in accordance with confidentiality obligations set forth in the Terms; (d) remain fully liable to the Customer Representative or Subscriber for the failure of those persons authorized by Personam.ai to access the Personal Data on Personam.ai ’s behalf; and, (e) make available such information as may be necessary to demonstrate compliance with its obligations under Article 28 of the GDPR and will (at the Customer Representative’s cost and expense) contribute to and allow for appropriate reasonable audits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trusted Parties currently engaged to process Personal Data on behalf of Personam.ai include the following: .</span></p>
<p><b>Security: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personam.ai limits its collection of Personal Data to only that which is relevant for purpose of providing the services under the Terms and retains Personal Data in a form that permits identification of data subjects (defined below) for no longer than is necessary to serve that purpose. Where no defined or legal retention period exists, the default standard retention period is six (6) years plus the year in which the record was created. Personam.ai shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</span></p>
<p><b>Data Subject Rights: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the scope of Data Protection Laws, Customer Representatives located in the EEA, the UK, Canada, or Australia (“data subjects”) may have certain rights that they may exercise, based on jurisdiction, in relation to the processing of their Personal Data. Where applicable, these rights include: the right to access, correct, update, and delete that data subject’s Personal Data, to withdraw any consent to processing, to opt out of communications, to restrict processing of Personal Data, and to make any claim or complaint in relation to their rights under Data Protection Laws, Personam.ai shall respond to and offer reasonable assistance in responding to data subjects’ requests to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable Data Protection Laws</span><b>.</b></p>
<p><b>Cross Border Data Transfer Mechanisms </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: To the extent your access and use of the Personam.ai Platform requires an onward transfer mechanism to lawfully transfer personal data from a jurisdiction to Personam.ai outside of that jurisdiction, the terms set forth in this section will apply. In the event your access and use of the Personam.ai Platform is covered by more than one transfer mechanism, the transfer of Personal Data will be subject to a single transfer mechanism in accordance with the following order of precedence: (a) the applicable SCCs as set forth in this section; and, if not applicable, then (b) other applicable data transfer mechanisms permitted under Data Protection Laws.</span></p>
